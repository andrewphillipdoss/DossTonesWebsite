    <h1 class="band-title-header">The DossTones</h1>
    <div class="band-bio">
      <p>We are a group of professionals...,
        including a couple of attorneys, a
        music teacher, a psychological
        counselor, a small-business owner...,
        and we have all been playing music in
        and around Nashville most of our lives.
        We play a lot of soul, jazz, blues and
        some pop oldies. The sax, B3/piano,
        and guitar give us range, and four of
        the players are also vocalists, so there
        is a lot of singing. We're flexible,
        dependable, and we enjoy playing
        early shows.
        Give us a shot..., we're confident you'll like what you hear!
