      <p>We are a group of professionals,
        including a couple of attorneys, a
        music teacher, a psychological
        counselor, a small-business owner,
        and we have all been playing music in
        and around Nashville most of our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        We play a lot of soul, jazz, blues and
        some pop oldies. The sax, B3/piano,
        and guitar give us range, and four of
        the players are also vocalists, so there
        is a lot of singing.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're flexible,
        dependable, and we enjoy playing
        early shows.
        Give us a shot, we're confident you'll like what you hear!
